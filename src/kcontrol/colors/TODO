query kwin for WM colors (post-4.0)
'are you sure' dialog when loading scheme if working scheme has changed - hook up fully
options (i.e. "things on the first tab") not saved in schemes (in kdeglobals only)
sort schemes list, 'current' at 0, 'default' at 1, everything else sorted (possibly kde3-style, user schemes on top?)
