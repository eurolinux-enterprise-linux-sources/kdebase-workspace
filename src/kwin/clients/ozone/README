This decoration is a fork of the Oxygen decoration, for reasons stated
in bug #152030 (comment #70 and others), namely Oxygen developers not
willing to accept widely-requested patches because of not fitting
the Oxygen vision and instead preferring a fork that's not branded
as Oxygen.

Everything is put into extra namespace called Ozone to make syncing easier.
All visible strings have Oxygen changed to Ozone.
Other things are not renamed to minimize conflicts as much as possible.
