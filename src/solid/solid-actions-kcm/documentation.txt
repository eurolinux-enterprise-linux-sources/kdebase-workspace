==========

Edit Action:

This screen allows you to change the settings of the action you selected. This includes Icon, Name, Command and requirements
You can change the icon by clicking on it. The requirements are displayed in a tree, the top item having to be true 
in order for the action to be shown. Each item can be either a "Container" or a "Requirement", which is selected when 
that item was added. Only Containers can have items below them. 

Containers can be one of two types, which will determine how they match their conditions. Either all or only one of the conditions
must match.

Requirements can also be different types. If the device matches them, they are true, otherwise they are false.

Add Requirement -> This is only available for containers, and allows you to select its type, and provide some initial
                   details for the requirement

Edit Requirement -> This can only be performed when a valid item is selected. It allows you to edit the various details
                    of that particular item type

Delete Requirement -> This is available for all items, except the root item. If a container contains any requirements,
                      they will also be deleted

==========

Edit Requirement:

This dialog allows you to change the various details about a container and will display different information,
Depending on what type of item it is.

Container Type -> You can only change one setting, the logic match. This is either "All must match" or "Any can match"
                  This will be used when determining if the container is true.

Item type -> This has many settings, with addtional ones available for some sub-types
    -> Restriction type: Only two settings are available: "Is value type" and "Compare value to"
                         Is value type checks to ensure the device is of the selected device type
                         Compare value to compares a value of the device with what you specify
    -> Device Type: You can select the device type here. This is used for limiting the selection of values for comparing
                    values, and direct matches for is device type.
    -> Value Name: This is only visible for "Compare value to". It allows you to select a device value to check
    -> Equals / Doesn't Equal: This determines what kind of match we are looking for when comparing the value. The
                               text to check is specified beside it
